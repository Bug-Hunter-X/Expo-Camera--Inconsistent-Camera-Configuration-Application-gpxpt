This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  Sometimes, when attempting to set specific camera properties (like flashMode or focusMode), the Expo Camera component ignores these settings, and the camera defaults to its internal settings. This is inconsistent and can lead to unexpected behavior in the app.  The code below demonstrates the issue. The camera may not always reflect the values assigned to `flashMode` and `focusMode`.
